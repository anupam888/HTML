        <span> <b> Hypertext Markup Language </b> :</span><br>
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
        browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document</p>
    <p id="item1" style="background-color: thistle;">
        <span> <b> Cascading Style Sheets:</b></span><br>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
        written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
        and JavaScript.[2]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

        <span> <b> JavaScript :</b> </span><br>
        JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it..</p>

        <span> <b> Bootstrap :</b> </span><br>
        Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

        Bootstrap is the sixth-most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 135,000 stars, behind freeCodeCamp (almost 307,000 stars) and marginally behind Vue.js framework.[2] According to Alexa Rank, Bootstrap getbootstrap.com is in the top-2000 in US while vuejs.org is in top-7000 in US.</p>

        <span> <b> jQuery :</b> </span><br>
       jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.[2] It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.[3] As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.[4] Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.[4][5]
